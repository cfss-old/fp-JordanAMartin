<h2> Method </h2>

<h3> Eye-tracking Paradigm </h3>

Eighteen-month-old infants were shown an eye-tracking paradigm in which a female agent reached for one of two toys on familiarization. On test, the agent raised her hand to midline, but did not complete a reaching action. Progression to the next scene was contigent on the infant making either a location- or goal-based prediction, as previously described. If the infant did not generate sufficient fixation, the scene progressed after a total of 8 seconds had elapsed from initial presentation. The task included four different agents and toy-pairs. Test trials were shown twice, each after a familiarization scene, for a total of 8 Test Trials. Two datasets of gaze-fixations were generated to investigate potential differences in the prescribed definition of a predicition from either the Hand AOI or Body AOI, as pictured below.

<h3> [Data Reduction](Tidying.html) </h3>


Load in data.
```{r Load Data, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
MOAP <- read_csv("data/MOAP.csv")
# Fix pesky `` issue
names(MOAP)[1] <- "Test"
# Drop NA rows
MOAP <- drop_na(MOAP, Hand_Prediction, Body_Prediction)
```

<h3> Exclusions </h3>

A total of 12 infants were excluded from analysis due to low calibration (n = 4), fussiness (n = 2), and sample rate < 50% (n = 6).

```{r Exclusions, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
filtered <- MOAP %>%
  filter(ID != "M08" & ID != "M11" & ID != "M14" & ID != "M17" & ID != "M18" & ID != "M25" & ID != "M26" & ID != "M27" & ID != "M30" & ID != "M31"  & ID != "M32"  & ID != "M33")

ValidTrials <- filtered %>%
  summarise(n = n())

kable(ValidTrials,
      col.names = c("Total"),
      caption = "Number of Valid Trials")
```

<h2> Analysis </h2>
<h3> Summary </h3>
<h4> Hand AOI </h4>

```{r Hand AOI Summary}
HandSummary <- filtered %>%
  group_by(Hand_Prediction)%>%
  summarise(n = n())

kable(HandSummary,
      col.names = c("Prediction Type", "Num Predictions"),
      caption = "Number of Predictions from Hand AOI")
```

<h4> Body AOI </h4>

```{r Body AOI Summary}
BodySummary <- filtered %>%
  group_by(Body_Prediction)%>%
  summarise(n = n())

kable(BodySummary,
      col.names = c("Prediction Type", "Num Predictions"),
      caption = "Number of Predictions from Body AOI")
```

<h3> Question #1 </h3>

Does varying initial fixation AOI from hand to body change prediction response?

```{r Prediction Proportions, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Graph Proportion of Predictions for each initial AOI
HandProp <- HandSummary %>%
  mutate(AOI = "Hand")%>%
  rename(Prediction = Hand_Prediction)
BodyProp <- BodySummary %>%
  mutate(AOI = "Body")%>%
  rename(Prediction = Body_Prediction)
AOIProp <- rbind(HandProp, BodyProp)%>%
  group_by(AOI)%>%
    mutate(prop = prop.table(n))

ggplot(AOIProp,
       aes(x=Prediction, y=prop, fill=AOI)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ AOI) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge')+
  labs(title = "Predictions by AOI", x = "Prediction", y = "Proportion of Predictive Fixations")
```

The graphs indicate that more predictions are revealed by an anlysis of fixations originating from the body than the hand. 

<h4> Compare AOIs </h4>

```{r Compare AOI, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Recode Predictions
HP <- filtered %>%
  filter(Hand_Prediction != "No Prediction")%>%
  select(ID, Trial_Num, Hand_Prediction, Hand_Latency, FamTrialLength_ms, Fam_Screen)%>%
  na.omit()%>%
  mutate(Prediction = ifelse(Hand_Prediction == "Distracter", 0, 1))%>%
  select(Prediction)
BP <- filtered %>%
  filter(Body_Prediction != "No Prediction")%>%
  select(ID, Trial_Num, Body_Prediction, Body_Latency, FamTrialLength_ms, Fam_Screen)%>%
  na.omit()%>%
  mutate(Prediction = ifelse(Body_Prediction == "Distracter", 0, 1))%>%
  select(Prediction)

tests <- list()
tests[[1]] <- t.test(HP$Prediction, mu=.5)
tests[[2]] <- t.test(BP$Prediction, mu=.5)

df <- sapply(tests, function(x) {
      c(x$statistic,
        x$parameter,
        x$estimate[1],
       ci.lower = x$conf.int[1],
       ci.upper = x$conf.int[2],
       `$p$ value` = x$p.value)
    })
colnames(df)<- c("Hand", "Body")
kable(t(df),
      caption = "Comparison of AOI Means")
```

Planned comparisons against chance (.5) revealed that when using the Body definition, infants launched predictive fixations systematically to the prior goal &#40;M=0.60, SD=.49, t&#40;88&#41;=2.04, p = .04*&#41;, whereas, when using the Hand definition, infants responded at chance levels &#40;M=0.48, SD=.50, t&#40;49&#41;=-0.28, p = .78&#41;. Therefore, remaining analyses will be performed on data generated from an initial fixation to the Body AOI.

<h3> Question #2 </h3>
Does latency vary between type of prediction?

```{r Latency, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
PredLat <- filtered %>%
  filter(Body_Prediction != "No Prediction")%>%
  select(ID, Trial_Num, Body_Prediction, Body_Latency, FamTrialLength_ms, Fam_Screen)%>%
  na.omit()%>%
  mutate(Prediction = ifelse(Body_Prediction == "Distracter", 0, 1))%>%
  group_by(Prediction)

tests <- list()
tests[[1]] <- t.test(Body_Latency ~ Prediction, data = PredLat)

df <- sapply(tests, function(x) {
      c(x$statistic,
        x$parameter,
        x$estimate[1],
        x$estimate[2],
       ci.lower = x$conf.int[1],
       ci.upper = x$conf.int[2],
       `$p$ value` = x$p.value)
    })
kable(t(df),
      caption = "Comparison of latency between predictions")
```

Planned comparisons against chance (.5) revealed that infants did not differ reliably in the time required to generate prior goal predictions (M=1628, SD=1591) compared to prior location predictions (M=2051, SD=2011; t(60)=1.04, p =.29). This sample fails to replicate findings that infants demonstrate significantly longer latencies when generating goal predictions. However, the standard deviations appear relatively high. Perhaps attention to the familiarization scene will parse differences in both proportional prediction and latencies to predict.

<h3> Question #3 </h3>
Can attention to the scene during the Familiarization trial predict whether or not an infant will generate any prediction?  

```{r Attention Prediction, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Calculate % attention
AttPrediction <- filtered %>%
  select(ID, Trial_Num, Body_Prediction, Body_Latency, FamTrialLength_ms, Fam_Screen)%>%
  mutate(Attention = Fam_Screen / FamTrialLength_ms)%>%
  mutate(Prediction = ifelse(Body_Prediction == "No Prediction", 0, 1))%>%
  arrange(FamTrialLength_ms)

# Convert to factor for analysis
AttPrediction$Prediction <- as.factor(AttPrediction$Prediction)

# Split model into Train and Test
train <- AttPrediction[1:110,]
test <- AttPrediction[111:130,]

# Fit the model
model <- glm(Prediction ~ Attention, family=binomial(link='logit'),data=train)
kable(tidy_x(model),
      caption = "Model Fit")
# Test variance
kable(tidy(anova(model, test="Chisq")),
      caption = "Model Variance")
```


YES!





<h3> Question #4 </h3>
Can attention to the scene during the Familiarization trial predict what type of prediction infants will generate when they do make a prediction? 

```{r Attention Prediction-Type, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
AttPredictionType <- filtered %>%
  filter(Body_Prediction != "No Prediction")%>%
  select(ID, Trial_Num, Body_Prediction, Body_Latency, FamTrialLength_ms, Fam_Screen)%>%
  mutate(Attention = Fam_Screen / FamTrialLength_ms)%>%
  arrange(FamTrialLength_ms)

# Convert to factor for analysis
AttPredictionType$Body_Prediction <- as.factor(AttPredictionType$Body_Prediction)

# Split model into Train and Test
train <- AttPredictionType[1:79,]
test <- AttPredictionType[80:95,]

# Fit the model
model <- glm(Body_Prediction ~ Attention,
             family=binomial(link='logit'),data=train)
kable(tidy_x(model),
      caption = "Model Fit")
# Test variance
kable(tidy(anova(model, test="Chisq")),
      caption = "Model Variance")
```

NO!


<h3> Question #5 </h3>
Can attention to the scene during the Familiarization trial predict the latency with which infant generate a prediction?  

```{r Attention Latency, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
AttLatency <- filtered %>%
  filter(Body_Prediction != "No Prediction") %>%
  select(ID, Trial_Num, Body_Prediction, Body_Latency, FamTrialLength_ms, Fam_Screen)%>%
  mutate(Attention = Fam_Screen / FamTrialLength_ms)%>%
  arrange(FamTrialLength_ms)

ggplot(AttLatency, aes(x = Attention)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Body_Latency))+
  facet_grid(. ~ Body_Prediction)+
  labs(title = "Attention and Latency to Predict", x = "Proportional Attention to the Familiarization Scene", y = "Latency (ms)")

Latency_lm <- lm(Body_Latency ~ Attention, AttLatency)
kable(tidy(Latency_lm),
      caption = "Model")
```

No!
