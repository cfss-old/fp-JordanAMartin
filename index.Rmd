## Introduction

Infant social attention, intention attribution, etc.

Developmental research has demonstrated that infants as young as 15-months recruit social information of a scene when making visual predictions (Krogh-Jesperesen, 2014). In an eye-tracking paradigm, infants are first familiarized to a video of a female agent acting on one of two toys. In test, infants view a scene in which the locations of the two toys have switched and the experimenter lifts her hand, but does not complete the reaching motion. Infants are said to make goal- or location-based predictions when they preferentially look to the previously grasped toy or previous location in which a reach was performed, respectively, after having first fixated on an area of interest defined about the agent's hand. When shown a video of actors either grasping or ambiguously brushing  one of two stuffed toys in familiarization, 15-month olds reliably made goal-based visual predictions for the grasping action, but not for the ambiguous brushing behavior. Additionally, on trials in which infants made visual predictions, goal-based predictions took longer to produce than location-based predictions. The theorectical explanation for this difference is that making goal-predictions are more cognitively challenging than making location-predictions because social information must be recruited and implemented to generate a "socially smart" response. Given this difference in latency, infants' attention to the scene in familiarization has been suggested as a predictor of socially-relevant goal-based predictions, such that infants who spend more time attending to the scene in familiarization may be more able to detect the change in the test event to accurately predict continued action on the prior object. In previous studies, predictions have been defined by a gaze fixation to either object after a fixation to an area of interest around the agent's hand. The current study sought to confirm the previous findings that goal-based predictions take longer than location-based predictions to elicit while comparing the proportion of predictions made that followed either an initial fixation to an area of interest around the hand or to an area that encompassed the agent's entire body. Additionally, the relationship between overall scene attention in the familizarization phase to the proportion of predictions generated on test is discussed.
